Current state: Demonstration prototype, work in progress

This is a long term project and I expect it to  include loads of data from DBpedia and other data sources in the future. The ultimate goal is to provide a reasonable alternative to closed source product search engines. Produpedia is free of ads, promotion, redirects or preferences. It will always be collaborative, transparent, independent and user-centered.

Your contributions are welcome! You can check out the issues if you're interested.
