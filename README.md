Current state: Demonstration prototype, in development

Active development will resume later this year, either June or September 2020. This is a long term project and I expect it to  include loads of data from DBpedia and other data sources in the future. The ultimate goal is to provide a competing alternative to non-free product search engines. Produpedia is free and open data, without ads, promotion, redirects or preferences. It will always be collaborative, transparent, independent and user-centered.

Your contributions are welcome! You can check out the issues if you're interested.
